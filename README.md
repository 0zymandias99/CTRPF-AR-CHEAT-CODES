# CTRPF-AR-CHEAT-CODES

Repository will not be ready for several hours! You are free to send pull requests to help out. Readme will be updated on how to use once everything is setup!

Format should go as such for pull requests If people want to go and ahead and send pull requests my way then I request that layout looks like so

`Cheats/<gamename (region)>/<tid>.txt`
so for example for
`Mario and Luigi: Dream Team Bros. Update 1.1 (EUR)`
the layout would be
`Cheats\Mario and Luigi Dream Team Bros. Update 1.1 (EUR)/0004000E000D9000.txt`
