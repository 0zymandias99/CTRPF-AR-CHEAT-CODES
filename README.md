# [Database] CTRPF AR CHEAT CODES

## How to use

After following either of the below you can look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2258P9wKkA) to see how to use the editor and create codes.

# Using Luma3DS with Plugin Loader

1. Download `Luma3DS 9.0 - Plugin loader.rar` & `ActionReplay.rar`
- Included in this repository or you can download from [here](http://gbatemp.net/threads/ctrpluginframework-blank-plugin.487729/)
2. Make sure you already installed the latest `Boot9strap` and `Luma CFW` and have a firmware of 11.4 or higher.
3. Rename any existing `boot.firm` in the root of your SD card to `boot.firm.bak` in case you want to go back, then drag the `boot.firm` from `Luma3DS 9.0 - Plugin loader.rar` into the root of your SD card
4. Place the conents from `ActionReplay.rar` into either
- `sd:/luma/plugins/<Title ID of the game folder>/`
  - Name of the plugin must be `plugin.plg` if placed here.
- or `sd:/luma/plugins/ActionReplay/`
  - Name of plugin must be `ActionReplay.plg` if placed here.
  - if placed here allows loading the `plugin` for all games if no specific plugin is found.
5. Either download or clone this repository or search in the cheats folder for the game you want to cheat on and download the `.txt` file in the folder
6. Move the `.txt` file to either
- `sd:/cheats/`
  - txt files are conviently already named correctly if placing here
- or place along side `plugin.plg` from #4 and rename the `.txt` to `cheats.txt`
7. Use your button combo to load up `rosalina menu` (default is usually `L+Down+select`) and enable `plugin loader` if it isn't already and then load up your game
- If you get a green screen during load then it worked
- To open CTRPluginFramework menu press `select` once in game

--
- Note: The plugin loader is automatically enabled on Old3DS because Mode3 games needs it.
- Note: So on N3DS, you have to enable the plugin loader from Rosalina, and you can disable it too. You can't disable it for Mode3 games though.
- Note: `Luma3DS 9.0 - Plugin loader` & `ActionReplay` are .rar files in this repository for convenience of updating with [MultiUpdater](https://github.com/LiquidFenrir/MultiUpdater) as 7z files are not supported.

# Using BOOTNTR
- If you decide to want to use `LUMAS3DS 9.0 Plugin Loader` alongside with `BOOTNTR` follow from the first step otherwise start at the second step!

1. Make sure to disable the plugin loader from Rosalina if you're using the `boot.firm` of `Luma3DS with Plugin Loader`
2. Download `ActionReplay.rar`
- Included in this repository or you can download from [here](http://gbatemp.net/threads/ctrpluginframework-blank-plugin.487729/)
3. Make sure you already installed the latest `Boot9strap` and `Luma CFW` and have a firmware of 11.4 or higher.
4. Place the contents from `ActionReplay.rar` into `SD:/plugin/<Title ID of the game folder>/`
5. Either download or clone this repository or search in the cheats folder for the game you want to cheat on and download the `.txt` file in the folder
6. Move the `.txt` file to either
- `sd:/cheats/`
  - txt files are conviently already named correctly if placing here
- or place along side `plugin.plg` from #4 and rename the `.txt` to `cheats.txt`
7. Open up BOOTNTR and let it do it's thing.
8. Load up game
- if you get a green screen during load then it worked
- To open CTRPluginFramework menu press `select` once in game

## If you wish to contribute

- codes that the CTRPF AR supports(Same as Gateshark but with more options!): [link](https://github.com/JourneyOver/CTRPF-AR-CHEAT-CODES/blob/master/ActionReplayCodeTypes.txt)

1. Fork repository
2. Add Cheats / Make changes to cheats / Other
3. Once done send a pull request back to this repository

or

1. Create an issue!
- NOTE: I didn't create these cheats, and some cheats might not work.
  - If a cheat is not working, it just means that the cheat is wrong: no support will be done for cheats not working, I'm not here to fix all cheats, if you need help with broken codes either make an issue or add a comment in this [thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/database-ctrpf-ar-cheat-codes.493220/) and somebody may be able to help you. Thank you!

## FAQS

1. Where can I put my cheat codes?
- Put them inside a text file called `cheats.txt` or `<Title ID of the game>.txt`.
2. Where should I put my `cheats.txt` or `<Title ID of the game>.txt`?
- Put them in `SD/plugin/<Title ID of the game folder>/cheats.txt`
- If your using the Luma Plugin Loader, Put them in `SD/luma/plugins/<title ID of the game folder>/cheats.txt`
- Or put them in `SD/cheats/<Title ID of the game>.txt`
3. Can I use both `cheats.txt` and `<Title ID of the game>.txt` files at the same time?
- No, you don't/shouldn't use both if you already have 1 .txt file for the game in one of the directories. You only need either a `cheats.txt` or `<Title ID of the game>.txt` for a game not both.
4. `LUMA3DS 9.0 Plugin Loader` only recognises `CTRPF (AR) Plugins` called `plugin.plg` and `ActionReplay.plg`
5. Make sure your using only 1 `CTRPF (AR) Plugin`! And No Other Plugins included alongside it! (Such as `Gateshark2NTR`, `libshark2NTR` or any other `Plugins`).
6. If it gives you error,Try Deleting the `CTRPFData.bin` if it exists.
7. If you can't find a game you are looking for, you can try [Max Cheats](https://www.max-cheats.com) and see if they possibly have it.

Extra Notes to myself
- Games - Inazuma Eleven 3 (EUR), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (USA) and (EUR), Shovel Knight (EUR) and (USA), LBX - Little Battlers eXperience (EUR) have 2 different `.txt` files. I Need to look into this.
