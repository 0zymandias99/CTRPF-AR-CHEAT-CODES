## How to use

1. Download `Luma3DS 9.0 - Plugin loader` and `CTRPluginFramework - Action Replay` (Included in this repository or you can download from [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/ctrpluginframework-blank-plugin.487729/page-6#post-7750475))
2. Make sure you already installed the latest `Boot9strap` and `Luma CFW` and have a firmware of 11.4 or higher.
3. Replace the `boot.firm` from the root of your SD Card with the Luma3DS 9.0 - Plugin loader.7z `boot.firm`
4. Place the contents from `CTRPluginFramework - Action Replay.7z` into `SD:/luma/plugins/<Title ID of the game folder>/`
5. Either download or clone this repository or search in the cheats folder for the game you want to cheat on and download the `.txt` file in the folder
6. Move the `.txt` file to either `sd:/cheats/` (txt files are conviently already named correctly if placing here)
7. Or place in same folder as the `plugin.plg` from #4 and rename the `.txt` to `cheats.txt`
8. Use your button combo to load up `rosalina menu` (default is usually `L+Down+select`) and make sure to enable `plugin loader` and then load up your game (if you get a green screen during load then it worked) and cheat to your hearts content!
9. To open CTRPluginFramework menu press `select` once in game
