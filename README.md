## FAQS

1. Where can I put my cheat codes?
- Put them inside a text file called `cheats.txt` or `<Title ID of the game>.txt`.
2. Where should I put my `cheats.txt` or `<Title ID of the game>.txt`?
- Put them in `SD/plugin/<Title ID of the game folder>/cheats.txt`
- If your using the Luma Plugin Loader, Put them in `SD/luma/plugins/<title ID of the game folder>/cheats.txt`
- Or put them in `SD/cheats/<Title ID of the game>.txt`
3. Can I use both `cheats.txt` and `<Title ID of the game>.txt` files at the same time?
- No, you don't/shouldn't use both if you already have 1 .txt file for the game in one of the directories. You only need either a `cheats.txt` or `<Title ID of the game>.txt` for a game not both.
4. `LUMA3DS 9.0 Plugin Loader` only recognises `CTRPF (AR) Plugins` called `plugin.plg`
5. Make sure your using only 1 `CTRPF (AR) Plugin`! And No Other Plugins included alongside it! (Such as `Gateshark2NTR`, `libshark2NTR` or any other `Plugins`).
6. If it gives you error,Try Deleting the `CTRPFData.bin` if it exists.
7. To turn off `LUMA3DS 9.0 Plugin Loader` restart your 3DS and don't enable the plugin loader again unless you need to.
8. NOTE: Games - Inazuma Eleven 3 (EUR), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (USA) and (EUR), Shovel Knight (EUR) and (USA), LBX - Little Battlers eXperience (EUR) have 2 different `.txt` files. I Need to look into this.
9. If you can't find a game you are looking for, you can try [Max Cheats](https://www.max-cheats.com) and see if they possibly have it.
