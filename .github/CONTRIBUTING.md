# Contributing to CTRPF AR CHEAT CODES Database

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to repository. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

All I ask when contributing is to for naming schemes to have the setup of one of the following:

`Cheats/<gamename (region)>/<tid>.txt`

EX: `Cheats\One Piece - Super Grand Battle X (JPN)\0004000000144400.txt`

or if the .txt file is only for a specific version then:

`Cheats/<gamename (update #.#) (region)>/<tid>.txt`

EX: `Cheats\Mario & Luigi - Dream Team (Update 1.1) (USA)/0004000E000D9000.txt`

I will accept `Rev#` or `v#` in place for `update #.#`

If for some reason you can't get the naming scheme to work on your computer please make a note of that in your pull request and I will fix it on my end.
